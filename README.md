## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

### What I learned

I learned about using the Constraint Validation API to validate HTML forms without using any third-party library. I also tried to make the form errors accessible by using attributes such as `aria-invalid` and `aria-errormessage`.

### Useful resources

- [Form Validation Part 2: The Constraint Validation API (JavaScript)](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-2-constraint-validation-api-javascript/) - This article helped me a lot with form validation using the Constraint Validation API in javascript.
